##Design Meets Disability

I think this text was VERY relevant, because it talks about problems faced by designers today. (I'm actually not sure if designer is the right word for it). I think finding the balance between form and function is extremely important- and also extremely tricky. The aforementioned balance is crucial because it can have such a significant impact on how the user is viewed by others, and more importantly themselves. Take eyewear, for example- once glasses became a fashion statement, people stopped viewing needing them as a disability- ironic, since normally sight is considered the most important sense (not that this is necessarily true, it’s just the way we seem to prioritise our perceptive senses). Even the terminology used to talk about these objects- eyewear as opposed to hearing aids, changes our perception of the person using them- you might not call someone with glasses a patient, but you would an amputee. 
This reading actually reminded me of one of the texts we read at the beginning of the semester- The Design of everyday things, and the relationship between ergonomics and aesthetics. The part about simplicity and accessibility really resonated with me, especially due to their connection to inclusive design. It actually made me think about art in a different way- does art have to be something we see in a gallery? Can’t it be something we use every day?
