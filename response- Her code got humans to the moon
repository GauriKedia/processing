##Response: Her Code Got Humans on the Moon—And Invented Software Itself

I really liked this article, not just because it highlights the (very crucial) role of a woman in a field dominated by men, but also because of the fact that it talks about the invention of software as a whole. I have to admit, it was kind of heartening (and also scary) to see how touch and go even a moon landing can be- it really taught me the importance of being calm under pressure and having good problem solving skills, not to mention having back up plans, and back up plans for back up plans. Reading about the process of coding and software in general was fascinating, because I’d always sort of taken it for granted, it’s always been around for as long as I can remember. 
It was GREAT to see a woman getting exposure in a field we normally assume is dominated by men- and still is, statistically (I think?). It showed me how far we’ve come and how far there is still to go.
